# About this bot

This bot is forked from `https://github.com/stilManiac/steamgifts-bot`. It's a bot for `https://www.steamgifts.com/`. This bot automatically enters the giveaways on the website for you.

I'm doing this bot in Typescript because I'm familiar with it, and also because JavaScript is used for websites. I'm using the code from the forked repository as an inspiration.
